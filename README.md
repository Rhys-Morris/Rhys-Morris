### Hi, folks! ðŸ‘‹
---
I'm Rhys, a developer in training from Melbourne, Australia. I'm currently enrolled in the Coder Academy Flex Track Bootcamp and loving it!

I currently work as a small animal veterinarian, quite a different field to software engineering. There's suprisingly a lot of crossover, however, and I've found the steps in diagnosing and fixing a programming error very similar to the systematic approach you take to diagnosing a problem in veterinary medicine. 

I'm passionate about good design, UI/UX and lifelong learning.

## Outside Work ðŸŒž

In my spare time I restore mid century furniture, mostly dating from the 1950s and 1960s. I really love the design aesthetic of the period: clean, fluid lines and natural finishes.
