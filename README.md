I'm Rhys, a software developer from Melbourne, Australia.

## Outside Work ðŸŒž

In my spare time I restore mid century furniture, mostly dating from the 1950s and 1960s. I really love the design aesthetic of the period: clean, fluid lines and natural finishes. You can find my instagram with some of my work [here](https://www.instagram.com/morrismodern/?hl=en)
